Important things to know before using:
1) You have to start and stop the game from my program, otherwise the repeating keys feature will be disabled even after the game is closed, if this happens just go in your terminal and type xset r on (in the future i will probably bind the program
to the terraria process to prevent this, but for now this will have to do)
2) I have tested this only on my computer, so i don't know if it will work on yours.
3) This is my first program that actually does anything practical, so i am sure there is a better and cleaner way to write the code.
4) While the game is turned on the repeating keys feature will be disabled, this might cause some inconvenience if you decide to alt + tab and do something outside the game, but it will work ingame so you can write in the chat normally
5) You need to have python 3 to use this.
6) Works 

To run the program open the terminal in the same location as the program and type python3 Play_Terraria.py, then type yes to start the game, and when you want to stop it, just type stop.
